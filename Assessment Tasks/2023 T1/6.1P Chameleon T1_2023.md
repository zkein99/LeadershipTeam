# <a name="exec"></a>Executive Summary

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

_EVAT_

The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

_MOP_

The City of Melbourne Open data division has been engaged with Melbourne City to support greater use of their Open Data library by businesses, researchers, and software developers. MOP delivers an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage Open Data using real-world scenarios which helps Melbourne City achieve one of their key strategic goals.

_CW_

The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company overall to present in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and useful components to display the progress of all 3 projects while outlining their goals. Which aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

# <a name="tri-goals"></a>Trimester Goals & Objectives

### <a name="objectives"></a>Objectives
Along with moving each of the Chameleon projects forward, closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.

- Document a policy for creating and storing documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. Once created, migrating company documents to GitHub converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future students to take the lead. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students (who are on lead) brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Have multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping. 




# <a name="projects"></a>Projects Overview

## <a name="eva"></a>EV Adoption Tools

The EV Adoption Tools project aims to drive increased adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Australia. This will help drive reduced dependence on fossil fuels, lower greenhouse gas emissions and have a positive impact on the environment and global weather events.

### <a name="location"></a>EV Charger Forecasting & Location Optimisation

#### Overview

Project EVCFLO provides aid to this cause through two key services: interactive maps using Google API, and an AI Prediction System, that recommends new Electric Vehicle Charging Station (EVCS) locations which will be used effectively by the relevant population.

#### Goals & Objectives

1. Using community data to expand on our database through the addition of newly found datasets.
2. Narrow down to the key external factors which impact the usage and success of EVs and EVCSs
3. Display newly discovered EVCS locations onto a visual map.
4. Integrate new EVCS locations onto our Google API interactive map (Web-Development team)

#### Aims this Trimester

Aim to integrate an interactive map that covers all EVCS locations across the globe to the website and implement an AI Prediction System that automatically and accurately recommends new EVCS locations for EVCS companies to utilize. Further, we aim to advance the project website by implementing design work completed by previous trimesters. 

#### Deliverables

- Expand on our EV Charge Location database through the addition of new datasets.
- Display newly discovered EVCS locations onto a visual map.
- Integrate new EVCS locations onto our Google API interactive map (Web-Development team).
- Improve the current visualisations (room for improvement).

### <a name="ema"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview

The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester

The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited.

#### Deliverables

- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

## Chameleon Website

#### Overview

The website for the Chameleon company overall aims to publicise the achievements and progress of Chameleon overall and showcase the sub-companies within it, one of the best ways to do this is through a website. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The main objectives of this website is to provide a one-stop for all – where it includes all the other sub-companies’ infortmation, objectives and links. We want to be able to use this website to advocate for the company, and be able to promote it while having the website be visually appealing, and comes with easy functionality.

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website majority, and make it optimised for mobile access. While the backend hasn’t been implemented, it means we have a lot of scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal, implementing API’s with SendGrid and Mailchimp and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing, with the design and web development skills of the students. We want to deliver a high-quality attrractive, easy to navigate and overall simple aesthetic of the website. This also means through using correct wireframing techniques within the design team, agreeing on a solid design that meets this criteria before implementing.

It will be imporant for the Chameleon Website to present all the other projects for the Chameleon company on the website, while this has currently been started – links have not been provided. 

Overall, reducing awkwardness on the website and providing a smooth experience is the overall aim for this trimester. 

#### Web Dev Team Progress 
This trimester, we have researched on databases so that they can be implemented within our user login pages, and along with this how API's can be used to implement this within our website. We focused on making our website more intuative and interactive for users, and created a SRS use cases document to continue using throughout the trimester. Additionally we also analysed for SEO startegy works so our website can be presented higher on a search engine. As the research has now been compiled, we plan to start changing the website and coding in the backend API's.

#### Web Dev Team Design 
The design team have developed low-fidelity designs, as well as produce high-fidelity designs for all pages of the Chameleon website. Researching and testing various colour schemes to create more modernised look with light and dark variations of the website. Research into the redevelopment of the Chameleon 'Resources' page has also identified the potential implementation of an event calendar to showcase company related events, FAQ and emerging IoT technologies. Development of low-fidelity page designs the EV Adoption Tools website has begun and the Evoleon mobile application is undergoing a redesign with the collaboration of the EV Adoption Tools web development team.

#### Deliverables

- Implement a more aesthetic and navigation friendly design
- Work on the blogging section of the website – add links to other projects
- Build the staff portal and implement the API’s behind it to get it running
- Reevaluate the Resources tab to see what can be added and removed from it
- Work on the fonts used and colour scheme of the website, and adding in different components to the website design
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Implement SEO strategy to rank the website higher in web search engines
- Building a client user account portal to view progress, updates and services of the Chameleon Projects
