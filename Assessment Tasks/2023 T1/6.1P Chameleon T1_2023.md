<a name="exec"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Executive Summary</h1>

### <a name="mission"></a>OUR MISSION

Given the complexity of energy application needs today, IoT systems are being designed to address a wide variety of existing problems.

In Chameleon, our mission is to research, create, test, document and deploy IoT-based solutions to enhance life through the application of smart city technologies. Including the building of smarter cities, homes, transportation, and energy management systems.

### <a name="structure"></a>OUR STRUCTURE

There are currently three divisions within the company, focusing on the three key areas of strategic importance:

- Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption Tools (EVAT)
- City of Melbourne Open Data (MOP)
- Chameleon Website (CW)

Both EVAT and MOP leverage datasets from several sources including data generated by IoT-based sensors and as such fit within the goals and mission of the company. The Chameleon website is our main online presence where we articulate who we are, what we do, and show case our projects to the world.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">EVAT</h4>
The EV Adoption Tools division currently has two projects underway. The first is a mobile application to help EV drivers locate and navigate to charging stations that meet the needs of their vehicles. The second uses big data to analyse the density of EV ownership, main transport routes (amongst other things) and recommends optimal locations for new EV Charging stations. 

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">MOP</h4>
The City of Melbourne Open data division has been engaged with Melbourne City to support greater use of their Open Data library by businesses, researchers, and software developers. MOP delivers an educational portal that demonstrates how to leverage Open Data using real-world scenarios which helps Melbourne City achieve one of their key strategic goals.

<h4 style="color:#336699; text-align:left;">CW</h4>
The Chameleon Website aims to accumulate all the information about the Chameleon company overall to present in a format that is pleasantly designed, laid out, easy to navigate and useful components to display the progress of all 3 projects while outlining their goals. Which aims to provide a one-stop portal to different links and sub-projects within the company.

# <a name="tri-goals"></a><h1 style="color:#336699">Trimester Goals & Objectives</h1>

### <a name="objectives"></a>T1-2023 Objectives
Along with moving each of the Chameleon projects forward, closer to their overall goals, we have identified the following areas for improvement this trimester.

- Document a policy for creating and storing documents with a focus on storing and managing key company documents on GitHub. Once created, migrating company documents to GitHub converting them to markdown in the process.
- Document the best practice policy for the maintenance of the company’s GitHub repository, this is to include how to prepare the repository for handover at the end of the trimester. 
- Document a policy and procedure for the overall handover process for the company making it seamless for future students to take the lead. This involves:
    - Centralising credentials and resources used throughout the company.
    - Have multiple junior students (who are on lead) brought into the handover process across all projects so that the knowledge does not sit with one team, project or person.
- Introduce cross-collaboration across all projects within the company
    - Sharing teams such as design & security
    - Have multiple cross-company meetings to get all team members (especially the juniors) familiar with the company as a whole.
    - Share wins, roadblocks, resources and topics across similar teams from other projects.
- Introduce and document Cyber Security best practices, and stress tests across all projects. This will introduce future tasks that the web development teams can complete.
- Implement a Design plan across all projects that details the colour scheme to layouts to high-fidelity quality produced wireframes with quality prototyping.

### <a name="evm"></a>Evoleon Mobile Application

#### Overview
The Evoleon App will help EV owners better plan their trips by identifying optimal EV charging stations as waypoints on their journey and provide them relevant information about those charging stations. 

#### Goals & Objectives
The goal of this project is to be able to design and implement a mobile app (Android and IOS) to help consumers identify nearby charging locations. Although there are existing products that are similar, here are a few examples of what the app may offer in addition to the core function of locating a socket: 
- Providing additional information and filtering of stations based on type (EV vs hydrogen, for example), information on the source of the power (direct solar, grid powered, gas, diesel etc).
- Providing a full journey planner for longer trips that optimizes for reducing charge time, cost and environmental impact along the route. 
- Ability to incorporate your usage data with current fuel prices, cost of maintenance etc and provide an indication of real savings for running the vehicle. 


#### Aims this Trimester
The aim this trimester is to continue implementing the designs created by previous teams and increase the applications functionality. A basic version of the app is currently working but it only has a few screens implemented and the functionality is very limited. Furthermore, the team aims to implement policies for shared coding practices to provide future teams with detailed references.

#### Deliverables
- Work on adding real EV Location data into the new Firestore locations database.
- Create a Navigation System for the applications map to travel to a selected EV Charger.
- Add an option to filter EV chargers on the map based on amenities stored in database for that EV charging location.
- Move the hamburger menu from the top left of the screen to a menu at the bottom of the screen, similar to the Figma designs.
- Complete a cyber security review of the app’s authentication process, data storage, code in GitHub repository, and apps terms and conditions.
- Add the process to reset a user’s password or delete an account.
- Continue adding user interface code for the applications pages.

#### Current Progress
The team has created a significant number of user stories, and team members have divided up the user stories into individual tasks. Majority of the team is focusing on the application development while a small portion of the team is focusing on enhancing the current design plans to align them more with the branding guidelines. The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed security review of Firestore database to ensure user details are not compromised.
- Implemented "About" Screen providing an overview of the application.
- Implemented functionality to update the application's version.
- Implemented "Terms and Conditions" Screen.
- Created password reset functionalities allowing users to reset their passwords if required.
- Implemented "User Details Update" Screen that allows users to change their personal details.
- Created a central Documents directory within the GitHub Repository and began adding policy documents in markdown.
- Updated GitHub repo readme to include a linking directory to the new policy documents. 

#### Next Steps
The team will continue to implement code for additional user interface pages along with adding user authentication functionalities. Furthermore, the team will focus on consolidating current achievements to form a plan for the handover process to ensure future teams have all the necessary information to continue working on the project.

<a name="playground"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Melbourne Open Data</h2>

#### Overview

The City of Melbourne has been an Australian leader in Open Data since 2014. The City of Melbourne initiated this project with Deakin to support greater use of their Open Data by businesses, researchers, and software developers. Open Data is a component of their smart cities' strategy.

#### Goals & Objectives

This project entails the development of an educational platform that showcases the practical applications of Open Data, specifically designed to cater to the needs of various stakeholders, such as industry professionals, government entities, and academic researchers. The primary objective of this project is to leverage the utilisation of the City of Melbourne's Open Data.

The long-term goal is to data useage, facilitating innovative and informed solutions to contemporary challenges across the City of Melbourne council area.

#### Aims this Trimester

The initial main focus is to read the documentation for the new API for the Melbourne Open Data Playground, and systematically work through each published (and yet to be published) notebooks and modify the code so that they will run if downloaded.

The aim for the Data Science team is to create a new set of use cases that fit within the 3 defined key areas of interest from the City Of Melbourne. The team is planning to complete a full set of use cases, and also have enough in the backlog for the next trimester when students will be focussed on InnoFes.

The web team is aiming to further streamline the processes for which the notebooks are published, and working with the design team to optimise the device browsing of our website. As part of the approach to the website, the cyber security team will also be scrutinising all apsects of our public-facing site to look for areas of vunerabilities that will need to be rectified.
The other main focus for the leadership is to document and streamline the way that the project is documented for handover at the end of each trimester.


#### Deliverables

- Update the API on all published notebooks (ready to be published again), and notebooks ready for publishing.
- Implement a human-readable URL
- Identify vulnerabilities in the source code, python code and database then document a roadmap to mitigatethem
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Complete analysis on multiple use cases (ready for publishing)
- Create multiple new use cases, allowing enough in the backlog for the next trimester
- Publish notebooks that are ready to be published
- Cleaner resources for the handover procedures for MOP
- Add more functionality to the website
- Implement some interactivity with JavaScript
- Fix the lingering deisgn / css issues within the website

#### Current Progress
The Data Science team has successfully completed repointing some of the APIs for the completed use cases ready to be republished, and also developed new use case ideas and started coding them up in jupyter.  The Cyber Security team have found vunerabilities, and are continuously documenting how the various approaches have been approached, as well ashow should be approached for when transferring the team to the other Chameleon projects. The Web Dev team have worked on making the styling for the published use cases match the over all theme, published backlog use cases and have been working on the mobile functionality for the website. The web team and design team have also been liaising for the next steps to integrate the team designs.

The list below outlines the team's main achievements so far:

- Completed repointing some of the published use case APIs.
- Completed defining a series of use cases to be explored by the DS team.
- Presented new use case ideas to the client at the City Of Melbourne.
- The source code has been inspected for vulnerabilities.
- Ports for the website have been scanned (5 open ports).
- The website has been stress tested for high amounts of traffic in small periods of time.
- Traversal attacks have been tested and do fail against the website.


#### Next Steps
The Data Science team will be completing the sprint 1 use case explorations and API repointing this current sprint, with everyone moving on to the next lot of use cases (or API repointing). The team will also be running another use case ideation workshop to create another series of use case stories to build more of a backlog.
The Security team will be focusing on implementing different types of attacks with different software to ensure vulnerabilities can be exposed allowing the Web Dev team to implement measures that will either prevent or stop these attacks as they happen. Members of the security team will also provide recommendations on any vulnerability that they do find. The web development team will be obtaining a new domain name for the website and also ensuring that the MOP website can access any relevant datasets using API links.

## <a name="cham"></a><h2 style="color:#336699">Chameleon Website</h2>

#### Overview

The website for the Chameleon company overall aims to publicise the achievements and progress of Chameleon overall and showcase the sub-companies within it, one of the best ways to do this is through a website. 

#### Goals & Objectives

The main objectives of this website is to provide a one-stop for all – where it includes all the other sub-companies’ infortmation, objectives and links. We want to be able to use this website to advocate for the company, and be able to promote it while having the website be visually appealing, and comes with easy functionality.

#### Aims this Trimester

The aim for this trimester will be to modify the front-end and the back-end of the website majority, and make it optimised for mobile access. While the backend hasn’t been implemented, it means we have a lot of scope to implement this from scratch. This includes setting up the staff log-in portal, implementing API’s with SendGrid and Mailchimp and creating a client portal.

For the front-end of the website, we aim to make the website more appealing, with the design and web development skills of the students. We want to deliver a high-quality attrractive, easy to navigate and overall simple aesthetic of the website. This also means through using correct wireframing techniques within the design team, agreeing on a solid design that meets this criteria before implementing.

It will be imporant for the Chameleon Website to present all the other projects for the Chameleon company on the website, while this has currently been started – links have not been provided. 

Overall, reducing awkwardness on the website and providing a smooth experience is the overall aim for this trimester. 

#### Web Dev Team Progress 
This trimester, we have researched on databases so that they can be implemented within our user login pages, and along with this how API's can be used to implement this within our website. We focused on making our website more intuative and interactive for users, and created a SRS use cases document to continue using throughout the trimester. Additionally we also analysed for SEO startegy works so our website can be presented higher on a search engine. As the research has now been compiled, we plan to start changing the website and coding in the backend API's.

#### Web Dev Team Design 
The design team have developed low-fidelity designs, as well as produce high-fidelity designs for all pages of the Chameleon website. Researching and testing various colour schemes to create more modernised look with light and dark variations of the website. Research into the redevelopment of the Chameleon 'Resources' page has also identified the potential implementation of an event calendar to showcase company related events, FAQ and emerging IoT technologies. Development of low-fidelity page designs the EV Adoption Tools website has begun and the Evoleon mobile application is undergoing a redesign with the collaboration of the EV Adoption Tools web development team.

The achievements so far can be seen in the list below:
- Completed research on database in the case of user login
- Use cases document has been created to help students analyse functionalities of the website
- API research on Sendgrid and MailChimp
- Designs being completed for majority of the website; lo-fi and hi-fi
- User personas have been created for all 3 websites

#### Next Steps
The next steps for the remainder of this trimester is to update the frontend code of the website to match the designs as produced by he design team, as well as work on the backend user signing in database and login setup and having this be functional. We also plan to implement a pop up notifcation subscriber method for users. Through the changes by the design team we have analysed the interaction of the website and how realisitic it will be for users. The design team will focus on working with the EV and MOP teams and their respective web development team leaders to begin design work for their websites and mobile applications. 

#### Deliverables

- Implement a more aesthetic and navigation friendly design
- Work on the blogging section of the website – add links to other projects
- Build the staff portal and implement the API’s behind it to get it running
- Reevaluate the Resources tab to see what can be added and removed from it
- Work on the fonts used and colour scheme of the website, and adding in different components to the website design
- Implement mobile views for the website
- Implement SEO strategy to rank the website higher in web search engines
- Building a client user account portal to view progress, updates and services of the Chameleon Projects
